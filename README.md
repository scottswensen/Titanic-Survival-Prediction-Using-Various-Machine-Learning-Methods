# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Methods
In this project, the data from Kaggle's Titanic survival data challenge is  analyzed using different machine learning methods to determine which method best predicts the survival rate observed in the data. The predictors include passenger class, age, number of siblings and/or spouses on board, number of  parents and/or children on board, the ticket fare, passenger sex, and the port of embarkation for each passenger. The data set is available here:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic The training set was split and used for training and validation since the provided test set on the Kaggle site does not include survival outcome.
